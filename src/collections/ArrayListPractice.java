		*Create a list with the following numbers: 1, 23, 9, 77, 922, 6, 32, 63, 14, 5, then: - determine whether each of the following values is an element in the list: 23, 77, 15 - remove the following elements: 23, 922, 32, 6 - again determine whether each of the following values is an element in the list: 23, 77, 15 (Stretch: create a method so that you don't need to duplicate this work.)
		*Come up with an example of how you might use each of the methods from the "More Tools" slide.
